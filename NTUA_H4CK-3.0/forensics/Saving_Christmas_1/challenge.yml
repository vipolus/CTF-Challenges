                This challenge consists of 3 parts. 

                Santa's personal assistant noticed unusual behavior on their computer didn't inform anyone. However, the situation escalated when they suddenly lost access to critical files Santa needs to complete his preparations.

                With time running out before Christmas, your task is to investigate the issue, determine what happened, and recover the vital files to ensure Santa can deliver gifts to children around the world. The holiday season depends on your skills and quick action!

                For the first part you need to understand out how the attackers got access in the system by finding the bellow:

                1st: Number of failed attempts
                2nd: The timestamp(UTC) of the first login.
                3rd: The timestamp(UTC) of first disconnect.
                4th: IP of the attacker
                5th: Hostname of the assistant's PC

                Example answers:
                1st: 53
                2nd: 2028-07-23 18:32:16
                3rd: 2028-07-23 19:13:18
                4th: 10.10.10.10
                5th: teststring
